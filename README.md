The Orchestre Philharmonique et Choeur des MÃ©lomanes (OPCM) is an organization founded in 2014 with the purpose of creating a distinct community of talented young musicians. It is through weekly rehearsal and a collaborative effort that we attain our musical endeavors. With our shared passion for classical music, we strive to share the experience and sensations of live music.
